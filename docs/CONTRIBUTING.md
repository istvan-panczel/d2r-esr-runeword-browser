# Documentation Process Guide

This document serves as the entry point for continuing documentation sessions with Claude. Link this file when resuming work on project documentation.

## Purpose

This project uses an iterative documentation process where:
1. The developer shares project details, requirements, and decisions
2. Claude maintains and updates documentation in the `docs/` folder
3. Documentation evolves as the project develops

## How to Continue a Session

1. Start a new conversation with Claude
2. Link this file: `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`
3. Claude will review current documentation status and continue from where we left off
4. Share new information about features, technical decisions, or requirements

## Topics to Cover

- [ ] **Tech Stack** - Libraries, frameworks, and tools
- [ ] **UI Components** - Component patterns, styling approach, design system
- [ ] **Features** - Core functionality and user-facing features
- [ ] **Architecture** - Project structure, data flow, state management
- [ ] **Coding Guidelines** - Conventions beyond what's in CLAUDE.md

## Current Status

## Documentation Guidelines

- All docs in Markdown format
- Place files in appropriate subdirectory:
  - `features/` - Feature specs, user stories
  - `technical/` - Architecture, guidelines, tech stack
  - `general/` - Overview, decisions, general info
- Update this file's status section after each session
- Keep docs concise but comprehensive

## Notes for Claude

When continuing documentation:
1. Read this file first to understand current status
2. Review existing docs in subdirectories for context
3. Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
4. Suggest improvements to libraries, patterns, or approaches when relevant
5. Update the status section after making changes
